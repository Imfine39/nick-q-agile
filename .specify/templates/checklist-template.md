# [CHECKLIST TYPE] Checklist: [FEATURE NAME]

**Purpose**: [Brief description of what this checklist covers, e.g. "Release readiness focusing on Articles I (Spec- & Test-First), IV (Testing Strategy & Integrity), and VIII (Spec-Driven Git Workflow) of the Engineering Constitution."]  
**Created**: [DATE]  
**Feature**: [Link to spec.md or relevant documentation]

**Note**: This checklist is generated by the `/speckit.checklist` command based on feature context and requirements.

<!-- 
  ============================================================================
  IMPORTANT: The checklist items below are SAMPLE ITEMS for illustration only.
  
  The /speckit.checklist command MUST replace these with actual items based on:
  - User's specific checklist request
  - Feature requirements from spec.md
  - Technical context from plan.md
  - Implementation details from tasks.md
  
  DO NOT keep these sample items in the generated checklist file.

## Spec & Requirements

- [ ] CHK001 All implemented behavior maps to one or more Spec IDs (e.g. `S-001`) with clear acceptance criteria.
- [ ] CHK002 All ambiguity is either resolved in the spec or explicitly marked (e.g. `NEEDS CLARIFICATION`) with a linked Issue.
- [ ] CHK003 Success criteria in spec.md are measurable and have corresponding tests or validation steps.

## Git & Workflow

- [ ] CHK004 Branch name follows the Issue-linked convention (e.g. `feature/<issue>-short-desc`).
- [ ] CHK005 Pull request references Issue(s) and Spec ID(s) and uses the approved merge strategy (e.g. squash).
- [ ] CHK006 No direct pushes to `main`; all changes flow through review with passing CI.

## Tests & Diagnosis

- [ ] CHK007 Critical paths and user stories (P1) have automated tests (unit, integration, and/or E2E as appropriate).
- [ ] CHK008 Any failing tests have documented root cause classification (spec bug / test bug / implementation bug / environment) and linked Issues.
- [ ] CHK009 No tests were changed or deleted solely to “make CI green” without justification in the PR.

## Notes

- Check items off as completed: `[x]`
- Add comments or findings inline
- Link to relevant resources or documentation
- Items are numbered sequentially for easy reference
