description: Implement tasks from the plan with tests and adherence to spec.
---

1) Confirm branch (Issue-linked) and current tasks.
2) Read relevant spec, plan, tasks; ensure Spec IDs/UC are clear.
3) Implement small, reviewable changes aligned to tasks.
4) Add/update tests first or alongside code.
5) Do not weaken or skip tests; classify failures (spec/test/impl/env).
6) Keep diffs focused; avoid drive-by refactors.
7) Summarize changes and tests run.
