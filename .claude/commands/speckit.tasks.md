description: Break the plan into tasks using the tasks template.
---

1) Load spec, plan, and tasks template.
2) Create tasks by UC and priority with IDs, Spec/UC references, and primary file paths.
3) Include test tasks (fail-first) before implementation.
4) Include Serena/context7 usage where relevant.
5) Keep tasks small and independently reviewable; avoid cross-story coupling.
6) Save to `tasks.md` in the feature directory.
